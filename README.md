# 365 Data Science Website Customer Engagement Project

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of customer engagement data for the 365 Data Science website. We used SQL for data retrieval and manipulation and Tableau for data visualization. The primary aim is to gain insights into customer behavior and engagement on the platform. We address several key questions in this analysis:

- **Course Popularity and Ratings:** Which courses are the most watched by students, and how are they rated?

- **Monthly Student Registration:** How many students register each month, and what fraction of them are also onboarded?

- **Engagement by Student Type:** How do students engage with the platform in terms of minutes and average minutes watched, based on their subscription type (free-plan or paying)?

- **Time-Based Engagement:** Do students watch more content over time, and does their engagement vary seasonally?

- **Country-wise Analysis:** Which countries have the most students registered, and does this number scale proportionally with the number of minutes watched per country?

## Data Sources

We retrieved and processed data from the 365 Data Science database using SQL. The data includes customer information, course data, and engagement metrics. SQL queries were designed to answer the specific questions outlined above.

## Tableau Dashboards

The results of our SQL analysis are visualized using Tableau. We created interactive dashboards to provide clear and intuitive representations of the findings. Each Tableau dashboard is designed to address one of the five key questions.

## Dashboard Navigation

- **Course Analysis Dashboard:** Explore the most watched courses and their ratings.

- **Registration Dashboard:** Analyze monthly student registration numbers and onboarding percentages.

- **Engagement by Type Dashboard:** Compare student engagement based on their subscription type.

- **Time-Based Engagement Dashboard:** Investigate how student engagement changes over time and whether it varies seasonally.

- **Country Analysis Dashboard:** Discover countries with the highest number of registered students and how this correlates with minutes watched.
